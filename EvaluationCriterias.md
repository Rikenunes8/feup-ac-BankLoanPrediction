# Data Mining Project - Banking Loans

## Business Understanding

### Analysis of requirements

The banks would like to have the possibility to guess with an high level of certainty if accepting a loan requested by a customer would be positive for the bank. The banks keep a lot of data about their cutomers, including their personal information and the actions they already take in the bank. For this reason, the banks hope this data to be enough to correctly accept or not the customer's loan.

### Definition of business goals

On banking loans world, banks would like to know when to accept a loan or not so they can increase gains and decrease losses. By analyzing customers, banks can draw conclusions about their customer's ability to keep their part of the deal. These conclusions may ou may not be 100% correct, however the goal is to make proffit by accepting loans only from costumers that are expected to pay.

### Data mining goals

According to business goals there data mining goals that can be set. We can understand that the priroty for the banks is to increase the ammount of loans rejected correctly. So that we can define a greater confidence interval at which loans should be accepted, let's say 80%. If the model is not at least 80% sure that the customer will pay the loan than the bank should refuse the loan. With this strategy, it's hope to have the **precision** measure greater than the **reacall** measure to fulfill the bank expectations about not accepting fallible loans.
